# DC-LEARN Operations Log

**Repository:** dc-learn-academy
**Started:** 06 April 2026
**Rule:** Append only — never edit previous entries. Every session adds one block before SHIP/NOT SHIP verdict.

**Grep cheatsheet:**
- Last deployed version per module: `grep DEPLOY DC_LEARN_OPS_LOG.md`
- Outstanding blockers: `grep NOTSHIP DC_LEARN_OPS_LOG.md`

## 2026-04-06 | Opus | ALL | Ops log creation
- [BUILD] DC_LEARN_OPS_LOG.md created — persistent append-only session log
- [DECISION] Inspired by Karpathy LLM Wiki log.md pattern, adapted for build-and-ship workflow
- [DECISION] Scope: DC-LEARN project only (16 modules). Separate LBE_OPS_LOG.md for other workstreams if needed later
- [DECISION] Karpathy Obsidian + Claude Code wiki pattern logged as post-launch candidate for regulatory monitoring (CRU, EirGrid, F-Gas, CRREM)

## 2026-04-09 | Opus | ALL | Stage 5 Session 1 — Schema + Stripe webhook
- [DECISION] Blockers cleared 09/04/2026: VAT (23% Irish B2B, required), Legal (disclaimer on certificates/modules sufficient), Positioning (intelligence layer only, locked 02/04/2026)
- [BUILD] supabase/stage5_migration.sql — idempotent migration with 6 tables: learner_progress, learner_pathways, learner_certificates, learner_analytics, companies, licences
- [BUILD] RLS enabled on all tables; "Users own data" + admin bypass via user_metadata.role='admin'; companies admin-only
- [BUILD] Conditional ALTER TABLE block preserves pre-Stage-5 licences columns while adding new columns (tier, amount_cents, stripe_payment_intent_id, status, expires_at, stripe_session_id)
- [BUILD] Admin seed for lmurphy@legacybe.ie inside DO $$ block — only fires if auth.users row exists; re-runnable after first magic-link sign-in
- [BUILD] netlify/functions/stripe-webhook.js extended — 4-tier PRICE_MAP (founding/professional/corporate/enterprise), subscription period-end → expires_at, amount-based tier inference fallback, idempotency guard via stripe_session_id
- [BUILD] docs/STAGE5_SCHEMA_DOC.md — table docs, RLS policy summary, Stripe→licence flow, failure-mode matrix
- [DECISION] Price→tier via env vars (STRIPE_PRICE_FOUNDING/PROFESSIONAL/CORPORATE/ENTERPRISE) — LM to paste IDs from Stripe dashboard before live deploy
- [DECISION] Licences table: service-role webhook inserts; client SELECT-only on own rows via RLS. Prevents client tampering with licence state.
- [GNEW] G-NEW-56: Stage 5 supersedes earlier learner_tiers schema — modules 000/003-015 still reference learner_tiers in dcAuth._loadTier; Session 2 replaces with licences query

---

## 2026-04-09 | Opus | ALL | Stage 5 Session 2 — AuthGate + PlatformSync batch roll
- [BUILD] /tmp/stage5-build/new_auth_block.txt — unified Stage 5 auth + sync block (~360 lines): dcAuth, AuthButton, LockedOverlay, useAuth, PlatformSync
- [DECISION] IS_FREE_MODULE derived from TOOL_ID at runtime — no per-file edit required, single source of truth: `(TOOL_ID === '000' || '001' || '002')`
- [DECISION] dcAuth.checkLicence(userId) queries new `licences` table where status='active'; returns null on any error so module falls through to IS_FREE_MODULE || dcAuth.isPaid() localStorage cache (Layer 1 never depends on Layer 2)
- [DECISION] Admin bypass: dcAuth.isAdminUser(user) checks user.user_metadata.role === 'admin' BEFORE licence query — admins get full access without licence row
- [BUILD] useAuth() hook: session → admin check → licence check → fall-through; all error paths console.warn only, never user-visible
- [BUILD] PlatformSync({user, progress}): flushes safeStore(DC_TIMING_KEY) → learner_analytics batch insert (≤500 rows, clears on success); upserts progress → learner_progress with onConflict user_id,module_id,level_id
- [BUILD] /tmp/stage5-build/transform.js — Node.js batch transformer with balanced-brace useAuth end detection; handles both basic (001/002) and extended (000/003-015) variants; idempotent via <PlatformSync user={authState.user}/ JSX guard
- [FIX] G-NEW-56 resolved: transform replaces extended variant's inner `const supa = null;` stub with `const supa = (typeof supabase !== 'undefined') ? supabase.createClient(SUPA_URL, SUPA_KEY) : null;` — Supabase now actually works in modules 003-015 (previously the inner const null shadowed the outer var supa createClient)
- [DECISION] dc-learn-000's duplicate outer `var SUPA_URL` + inner `const SUPA_URL` coexists safely: outer `var` goes to window, inner `const` is script-scoped to Babel block — no runtime conflict, no edit needed
- [BUILD] Batch transform applied: 16/16 modules replaced auth block, 13/16 replaced supa stub, 16/16 inserted `<PlatformSync user={authState.user} progress={progress}/>` after `<LockedOverlay/>` JSX line
- [BUILD] Babel syntax-check via @babel/standalone + preset-react: **16/16 PASS**
- [SWEEP] Post-transform audit: 0 lingering `learner_tiers` refs, 0 lingering `authState.loggedIn/email/tier` refs, 0 lingering `dcAuth._loadTier/isLoggedIn/userEmail` refs, 16/16 have `dcAuth.checkLicence` + `function PlatformSync` + BookTab intact
- [GNEW] G-NEW-57: LockedOverlay references `LOGO_SRC` — verified present in all 16 modules (inner Babel const); no fix needed
- [GNEW] G-NEW-58: PlatformSync depends on `safeStore`, `DC_TIMING_KEY`, `TOOL_ID` — all three present in every module (confirmed by grep)
- [DECISION] No separate "outer Supabase init block" added — all 16 modules already have working supa client (002/001 via inner `const supa = createClient`, 000/003-015 via outer `var supa = createClient` + now-fixed inner re-init). Per Stage 5 rule "Layer 1 never depends on Layer 2" — no behavioural change if Supabase CDN is blocked.
- [DEPLOY] Branch: claude/supabase-auth-content-gating-vJVFr
- [SHIP] Stage 5 Session 2 ready to ship — 16/16 Babel pass, all failure modes fall through to localStorage, no user-visible regressions.

## 2026-04-10 | Opus | ALL | Fleet-wide content & quality audit
- [SWEEP] Fleet audit complete — 16/16 modules scanned, report delivered
- [SWEEP] Checks executed: stale values (1A/1D), banned terminology (1B), Mark voice (1C), version consistency (1E), IS_FREE_MODULE (1F), EED Art.26 (1G), service codes (1H), scenario terminology (1I), hall naming (1J), content depth (Task 2), assessment distribution (Task 3), known defects D1–D4 (Task 4), Supabase schema snapshot (Task 5)
- [SWEEP] Defect totals: 6 P1, 4 P2, 14 P3. Modules 000 and 007 are lowest launch-readiness (terminology replacement bugs + assessment bias). Modules 012 and 014 are cleanest.
- [SWEEP] Known defects D1 (001 TODO), D3 (004 missing L9), D4 (001 tab style) all RESOLVED. D2 (004 L6 narrative leak) not reproduced but 3 truncated rhetoric texts found nearby.
- [SWEEP] 6 fix sessions recommended: A (terminology 30min), B (assessment rebalance 45min), C (C&E depth 2hrs), D (text corruption 15min), E (version comments 20min), F (Mark voice 30min)
- [DECISION] Report saved: DC_LEARN_FLEET_AUDIT_REPORT_v1_0.md — LM to review before fix sessions begin
- [GNEW] G-NEW-73 enforced: zero code changes, zero fixes — audit only

- [SWEEP] Fleet check: all 16 modules within 5–8 per position (adjusted for useState false positives). No deviations.
- [DECISION] Option text, question text, and explanations unchanged — position rotation only
- [BUILD] Babel syntax check: 16/16 PASS
